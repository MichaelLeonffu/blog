# Blog

Yet another blog.

This iteration I will host the blog on github pages.
It will be a static site built with go html/template and hosted on gh-pages branch.

## Features

- [x] Markdown support
- [x] Front-matter support
- [x] Categories
- [x] Tags

I'll be using the vs code Font Matter extension to help create the md documents and it's metadata.

Later I will write/use a static site generator to generate the html files to host on github.
