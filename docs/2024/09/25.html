  It is Monday. I turn 25 today.
  <br><br>
  Everyone is occupied with school or work. I have the day off.
  <br><br>
  I write this during the evening. The day passes quickly.
  <br><br>
  This morning, my phone died. I am very lucky for that, it gave me time to think.
  <br><br>
  I enjoy thinking in the mornings. I believe it allows the creativity and consciousness to flow.
  <br><br>
  Now, in the evening, I forgot the wonderful ideas I had this morning.
  <br><br>
  I try to make my birthdays and new years the ideal day for myself. Get up early, make and eat a good breakfast, clean,
  read, walk, talk to family, study, and sleep early.
  <br><br>
  Today is not that.
  <br><br>
  Today was like any other.
  <br><br>
  That's what happens when you turn 25.
  <br><br>
  Nothing.
  <br><br>
  If you don't write down the things you want to do. The ideas that you have in the mornings. It amounts to: nothing.
  <br><br>
  What good is writing? If you don't take action on those ideas.
  <br><br>
  I enjoy thinking in the mornings. Now that I'm 25, I need to do more than enjoy it.
