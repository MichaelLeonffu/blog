It is Monday. I turn 25 today.

Everyone is occupied with school or work. I have the day off.

I write this during the evening. The day passes quickly.

This morning, my phone died. I am very lucky for that, it gave me time to think.

I enjoy thinking in the mornings. I believe it allows the creativity and consciousness to flow.

Now, in the evening, I forgot the wonderful ideas I had this morning.

I try to make my birthdays and new years the ideal day for myself. Get up early, make and eat a good breakfast, clean, read, walk, talk to family, study, and sleep early.

Today is not that.

Today was like any other.

That's what happens when you turn 25.

Nothing.

If you don't write down the things you want to do. The ideas that you have in the mornings. It amounts to: nothing.

What good is writing? If you don't take action on those ideas.

I enjoy thinking in the mornings. Now that I'm 25, I need to do more than enjoy it.
